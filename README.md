# Express.js Web DevTemplate

This template is an Express.js project template that helps you get started with web development using Express.js. It includes:

- Full project structure
- Intermediate Express.js configuration
- Robust and advanced api routing, setup, and error handling
- Authentication and authorization middleware with session authentication
- Implemented security best practices
- Logging middleware

It does **NOT** include:

- Database connectivity
- Testing

## How to get the template

You will be able to get this template and set it up for any Express.js project. You can do this by copying the snippets below. This will create a brand new folder with the contents inside as clone does, but there is no git folder and it will be yours. Do not clone this repo directly, as you'll be directly modifying the template and won't be able to use it as a base for your own project.

## 1. Getting the project folder

### If you use SSH

```sh
npx tiged izzymadethat/express-web-dev#main <your_project_name>
```

### Via HTTPS:

```sh
npx tiged https://github.com/izzymadethat/express-web-dev <your_project_name>
```

## 2. Installing dependencies

if you are not already in the project folder...

```sh
cd <your_project_name>
```

Then run...

```sh
npm install

```

### 3. Running the project

- Write all of your logic and routes as you see fit.
- Logging, basic middleware, and the server configuration are already set up.

#### Running the server

In development mode:

```sh
npm run dev
```

in production/non-debugging mode:

```sh
npm start
```

### And that's it!
